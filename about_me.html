    <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <p>My favorite restaurant is <a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">The Local Eatery</a>. I love their farm-to-table approach and the freshness of their ingredients. Every meal there feels like a gourmet experience.</p>
    
    <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
    <img src="favorite_food.jpg" alt="Delicious pizza" class="food-image" width="200">
    <p>I absolutely love pizza, especially when it's served with a perfectly crisp crust and a mix of mozzarella and fresh basil on top. I like to eat it right out of the oven, hot and melty!</p>
